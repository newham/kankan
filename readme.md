# Kan Kan

[中文](readme.zh.md) 

As yout can see, the image preview software of Mac OS has a terrible experience:  it can't be zoomed in with the scroll wheel, and it doesn't support viewing all the pictures in the folder directly...   
So, I developed this software.   
Kankan is a Mac OS software to help you quickly look pictures. The experience is similar to win10's "image" and "king of pictures" apps.

3.Enlarge image by wheeling support   
4.Drag image support  
5.Support browsing all images under the folder  
6.Support previous, next and cycle browsing
